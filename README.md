Hi, I'm Poorvi Varshney, a passionate self-taught python Developer from India. I love to know how stuff works internally and enjoy tweaking it in order to learn more. Apart from python language,  I also have interest working with Web Development.

I am also a competitive programmer. Participating in programming contests has improved my problem-solving skills and also sharpen my data structures and algorithms in a fun competitive way.
